# Introduction to Bootstrap
Microsoft: DEV203x Introduction to Bootstrap

## About this course
Bootstrap is an open source project originally created by Twitter to enable creation of responsive,
mobile first web pages. Bootstrap has a standard set of classes that allow developers to quickly create
applications that scale to devices of all sizes, and incorporate common components such as dialog boxes
and validation. Bootstrap has become a defacto standard for web design.

This course is designed to be a primer on Bootstrap. In completing this course, you will learn to create
pages common to all web applications, and implement the most frequently used components and
classes provided by Bootstrap. You will also learn how to use the tooling provided by Visual Studio to
assist you in creating pages as quickly as possible.

### Module 1: Getting Started with Bootstrap
During our first module we'll cover the basics of Bootstrap and the grid system. You'll see how to obtain
and add Bootstrap to your pages, and why Bootstrap makes developing responsive pages simpler than
using CSS directly. We'll also explain how the grid system works to layout your pages.

### Module 2: Page Design and Data Display
Bootstrap offers several features to ensure your page is designed optimally for all screen
sizes. You'll examine how to best use those capabilities to ensure users can easily consume the data they
need regardless of their device type. You'll also see how to use some of the advanced components, or
controls, that Bootstrap offers.

### Module 3: Forms and user interaction
We'll close our exploration of Bootstrap by taking a look at how we can obtain data from the user and
provide feedback. Bootstrap offers great support for customizing forms, and several options to let the
user know when the form is correct or incorrect. You'll see how to add alerts and modal dialog boxes, as
well as inline validation and data prompts.
